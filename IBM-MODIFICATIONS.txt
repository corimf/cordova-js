- Cordova RTC work item number: 59037
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5916
- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference: 
- Product PMR: 41288,057,649
- Worklight RTC work item number: 58719
- Description: After fix the window.blackberry.invoke(), part of the blackberry plugins, 
  an optimization to the added code was required.
  window.webworks.exec is non-required, what's required is 'webworksready' event.
  As part of the optimization, support for Webworks 2.x was added in the code.
  Now projects can handle WW 1.x and in case of upgrade, it can support WW 2.x as well.

Get BB10 window.blackberry.invoke() to work with WL 6.2 and WebWorks 1.x.

- Full description: the window.blackberry.invoke() method was not working with
  version 1.x of the WebWorks SDK. It appears that Cordova after 2.8 is
  geared for WebWorks v2.x. Worklight is still assuming WebWorks v1.x.
